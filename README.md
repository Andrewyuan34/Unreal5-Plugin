# Unreal Engine Plugin Project

## Project Goals and Learning Objectives

This project aims to develop a practical Unreal Engine plugin while focusing on:

1. Industry-oriented design philosophy - weighing pros and cons from a practical perspective
2. Balanced technical scope - covering broad UE features while managing depth
3. Iterative development approach - top-down design with flexibility to adapt
4. Comprehensive documentation - tracking design decisions and rationale
5. Toolchain proficiency - mastering UE development tools and workflows

## Outcomes

- Deepen understanding of Unreal Engine architecture
- Build experience with real-world game development challenges
- Familiarize toolchain related to Unreal Engine

## Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the `docs` directory, including:
- Design decisions and rationale
- Technical specifications
- Implementation details
- Learning resources and references

## Current Status: Investigation Phase

The project is currently in early exploration stage, focusing on:
- Understanding UE5's existing street map capabilities
- Researching PCG (Procedural Content Generation) features
- Evaluating potential integration points
- Exploring possible use cases and features
