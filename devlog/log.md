# Development Log

1. **Art Workflow**
   - Important to understand the downstream workflow for game programmers
   - This is a current weak point for me, therefore have the need to pay attention to art workflow related design and implementation

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - While art workflow is important, avoid spending excessive time on art-related considerations during implementation
   - Balance between understanding art consideration and maintaining development efficiency

### Rationale
- As a game engine developer, understanding art workflow is necessary but not the primary focus for this project.
